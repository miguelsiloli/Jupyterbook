Second hand clothing are on their way to dethrone mid and low tier clothing brands. Both cheap off price retailers and high end luxury should be safe. This marks a **new generation of customer behavior**.

> Millennials and Generation Z consumers, in particular, are driving the demand for sustainable fashion and are active participants on platforms like Vinted.
